<h1>  Đinh Quý Dương  </h1>
<p style="font-family: Arial"> I am currently a postdoc at Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany. </p>

<p style="font-family: Arial">
I completed my PhD in Mathematics (2023) and Master in Mathematical Physics (2019) at University of 
Hamburg, under supervision of J. Teschner. Before that, I completed a dual bachelor degree in Math and 
Physics at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2017.

<h3 style="font-family: Arial">Research interests</h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial">
I am broadly interested in the algebraic and differential geometry inspired by ideas from physics. </p>

<p style="font-family: Arial">
A focal theme of my research is the analytic Langlands correspondence, conjectured by Teschner 
and developed by Etingof-Frenkel-Kazhdan. 
The central objects of the analytic Langlands correspondence, regarded as a variant/refinement 
of the geometric Langlands correspondence, are no longer sheaves but functions which are 
eigenfunctions of Hecke operators. 
This calls for an exploration of rather explicit nature. 
My approach (with Teschner) involves revisiting and making explicit 
certain aspects of two early approaches to the geometric Langlands correspondence: 
the first one by Drinfeld using Radon transform and the second by Beilinson-Drinfeld using 
conformal field theories techniques. 
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial">
I am also interested in the inherent geometric aspects of the moduli of Higgs bundles and related ones, such 
as moduli of flat/projective connections on Riemann surfaces. Conformal limits, natural stratification and  
deformation of symplectic structures on these moduli spaces are the usual ingredients I work with. 
Recently, I like to think about a concrete description of branes and their mirrors in the moduli of Higgs bundles.
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial">
I have also developed interests in:
<ul style="font-family: Arial">
<li> the interaction between random geometry (e.g. Schramm-Loewner evolution), real enumerative geometry
and conformal field theories;
<li> Donagi-Pantev-Simpson's approach to geometric Langlands, which uses mirror symmetry 
and non-abelian Hodge theories, and its relation to Drinfeld's approach;
<li> Bridgeland's spaces of stability conditions and his complexification of moduli of Higgs bundles;
<li> a geometric understanding of the Verlinde formula.
</ul>
